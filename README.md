## Setting up git and github
- Creating github account: https://github.com/signup
- Downloading git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Installing git (guide): https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-git-windows

  Note: In that guide, Ignore `How to Launch Git in Windows` and later.

## Basic terminal commands for navigation
**NOTE:** For Windows users, use `Git Bash` for running the commands. It comes with the git installation. For this session, we will be using `Git Bash` for running the commands.
- 
1. `pwd` (Print Working Directory): Displays the current directory path.

   Example:
   ```bash
   $ pwd
   /home/user/documents
    ```
2. `cd` (Change Directory):
    - To move forward (into a subdirectory):
      ```bash
      $ cd directory_name
      ```
    - To move backward (up one directory):
      ```bash
      $ cd ..
      ```
    - To move up two directories:
      ```bash
      $ cd ../..
      ```

3. `ls` (List): Lists the files and directories in the current directory.

    Example:
    ```bash
   $ ls
    file1.txt file2.txt directory1 directory2
    ```

## What is version control system?
- Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
- Version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter.

- The types of VCS are:
    1. Local Version Control System
    2. Centralized Version Control System
    3. Distributed Version Control System
- Git is the most well-known example of distributed version control systems.
